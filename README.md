# Overview
This is a Simple program that will use JavaScript and Tensorflow to create a mahine learning model that can predict the output for certain datasets. It is something I wanted to make a short video on.

This uses visual studio code and Xampp which are free to everyone.

Thsi will help others who are leaning JavaScript like me to jump into machine learning and programing in general.
